**Errors:**
The error message in the image indicates that your Python script is attempting to access a network socket in a way that is not permitted by the operating system. 
To resolve this, you can try the following:

Run the script as administrator:

Check firewall settings:

Make sure your firewall isn't blocking network traffic for the script. You may need to create a rule to allow the script to receive and send network packets.
Verify network interface:

Ensure that the network interface you specified in the interface variable is correct and active. You can use the ipconfig /all command in the command prompt to check your network interfaces.

Check for other processes:

If another process is already using the same network interface or port for packet sniffing, it might interfere with your script. Try closing any other network monitoring applications or processes.
